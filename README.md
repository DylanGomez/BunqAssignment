<h1> Chat Application for Bunq </h1>

First things first, thank you for letting me parttake in this assignment!

Disclaimer: this chat application doesn't work and you can't send messages from one user to the other.
I unfortunately couldn't figure out how it could work, so instead of having something that works, I made an
start in an application that can be finished once there is enough time to research everything there is to make an working chat.

<h2> Focus points </h2>

I mainly focused on setting up the code and making sure that someone can look at the code, and directly understand how it would
work and what every variable means and holds. 

I used Composer to get most of the imports that were important for the functionality for some of the methods used in the Controllers.

As for frameworks, I used the MVC framework to split most of the PHP classes in their rightful Directories.
I did this because of how easily it can be understanded by someone that just starts up the project.

I hope that this information can help you to understand this project a bit better. For additional information about me or this project I can be reached through my email.

I also strongly advise to look through my other repositories to get better understanding about what I can acomplish.
This projects wasn't a big succes due to different complications happening at the same time.
